# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array. The query incorrectly returns no results, even if the field exists in the documents.

## Problem

The `$in` operator in MongoDB is used to match documents where a field value is in an array of values. If the array is empty, the query should ideally return all documents, because any value is technically 'in' an empty set. However, the behavior in MongoDB is that it returns no documents.

## Solution

The simplest solution is to use an alternative approach to avoid the use of an empty array with the `$in` operator. A suitable alternative for this specific scenario would be to use a `$or` operator or a different operator altogether depending on what results are intended.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.js` which shows the incorrect behavior of $in with an empty array.
3. Run `bugSolution.js` which shows a corrected solution.
